            <p>Hii, I am Chetan, a 19 years old student, pursuing B.Tech Computer Science Engineering (with specialization in Data Science) from Netaji Subhash University of Technology, Delhi. Although I am a newbee to development but I am really inclined towards it and I want to expand my horizon of knowledge in the field of Development & for that I think GDSC society would be the best option for me as here, I will get a chance to learn from my helpful seniors, who already have a great knowledge in this field and a great peer group of tech enthusiasts. I also want to explore other fields of development as well such as Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence. I also want to do Competitive Programming and have a aim to become 7 star coder in Codechef & Codeforces Grandmaster.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Apart from career, I like to listen music. I am an introvert but that doesn't mean that I am not a team player. Even in inter-school competitions, I used to participate in team competitions and majority times, our team used to win. I like to travel a lot as well, though, I am a little bit camera shy. </p>
